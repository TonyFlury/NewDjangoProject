New Python Project cookiecutter template
========================================

This cookie cutter template is designed primarily for my personal
use but it does contain a number of features which may well be
interesting to other people : 

#. Automated creation of github repository
#. Options for Py27 and Py35 projects
#. Automated creation of virtual environments for Py27 & Py35
#. Special case for cli projects (adds click module to virtual enviornments - can be extended)
#. Initial config for Sphinx documentation tool, and initial documentationsource code
#. Special case for creation of project without github rep creation
#. Initial config for tox & travis
#. Options for choice of license (MIT, GNU, Apache - easily extensible)
#. Initial config for PyCharm - including recording virtual envs and opening first source code and README file
    
If you find any issues - please let me know.
